## Why ClipChronicle?

ClipChronicle is designed to be the ultimate clipboard companion, addressing the limitations of traditional clipboard managers:

- **Not being able to see what you copied** ‚Äì Traditional clipboard managers often only show the last copied item, making it hard to find older snippets.
- **Lack of organization** ‚Äì Many clipboard managers lack robust tagging or folder systems, leading to chaos as your history grows.
- **Limited search capabilities** ‚Äì Searching through clipboard history can be slow and imprecise, especially with large datasets.
- **Cannot update/delete copied items** ‚Äì Once something is copied, it‚Äôs often set in stone, making it hard to correct mistakes or update information.
- **No AI assistance** ‚Äì Most clipboard managers do not leverage AI to enhance productivity, such as summarizing or translating snippets.
- **Privacy concerns** ‚Äì Many clipboard managers store data in the cloud, raising security and privacy issues.

Thus, ClipChronicle was born to solve these problems with a **local-first**, AI-enhanced clipboard experience that captures everything you copy, organizes it intelligently, and makes it instantly searchable‚Äîall while keeping your data private and secure:

- **Capture everything** ‚Äì text, rich text, images, colors, code snippets, and more.
- **Never lose a copy** ‚Äì unlimited history that survives reboots and reinstalls.
- **AI-enhanced productivity** ‚Äì smart actions like summarization, translation, and refactoring at your fingertips.
- **Local-first design** ‚Äì everything runs on your machine, ensuring privacy and speed.
- **Manage clipboard with ease** ‚Äì organize snippets with favorites, manual delete, and smart tags.
- **Instant search** ‚Äì fuzzy lookup returns results in under 10 ms at a million rows.
- **Visualizations** ‚Äì analytics dashboard shows copied item type, copy frequency, and more to help you understand your clipboard usage!
- **Cross-platform** ‚Äì available as a desktop app and a browser extension.
- **Cross-browser** - our browser extension is also available on/compatible with browsers other than Google Chrome, such as Firefox and Microsoft Edge!
- **Open source** ‚Äì built with love by the community, for the community. All code are fully open and transparent.
- **Dark/Light mode** - the native app also features a dark mode for a comfortable viewing experience at night, plus a light mode for daytime use.

> [!NOTE]
> ClipChronicle is not just another clipboard manager; it‚Äôs a **second brain for your clipboard**. It empowers you to focus on what matters most - your work - while it takes care of the mundane task of managing your copied content!

## Quick Start

ClipChronicle is designed to be easy to set up and use. Follow these steps to get started quickly:

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- `Node.js` (v18+)
- `pnpm` (install via `npm install -g pnpm`) or `npm` or `yarn`
- `Git`
- `Rust` (for clipboard hooks, optional but recommended)
- `Docker` (for development environment, optional)

### Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hoangsonww/ClipChronicle-Cross-Platform-App.git
cd ClipChronicle-Cross-Platform-App
npm install
```

### Setup & Launch the Landing Site

```bash
cd clipchronicle-landing
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run dev   # http://localhost:3000
```

> [!NOTE]
> We are using `--legacy-peer-deps` to avoid peer dependency issues with React 19 and Shadcn UI.

### Setup & Run the Desktop App

```bash
cd ../electron-app
npm install
npm start
```

To build the desktop app for production:

```bash
npm run make
```

This will create platform-specific installers in the `out` subdirectory, with a `.zip` for Linux, `.dmg` for macOS, and `.exe` for Windows.

### Setup & Build the Extension

First, build the extension so that you can test it on your browser:

```bash
cd ../extension
npm run build
```

Then load `extension/dist` as an unpacked extension at `chrome://extensions`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to enable the **Developer mode** toggle in the top right corner of the Extensions page.
>
> Also, ensure that you have enabled necessary permissions for the extension. This can be done by right-clicking the extension icon, selecting **View Web Permissions**, and granting access to all sites or specific domains as needed.

> [!TIP]
> Sometimes, the extension may not work immediately after loading. If you encounter issues, try reloading the extension or restarting your browser (or reloading the page that the extension is active on).

> [!NOTE]
> Due to browser security policies, the extension may not **ALWAYS** function correctly on all websites. If you encounter issues, try disabling any conflicting extensions or adjusting the extension's permissions.

## Environment Configuration

Environment variables are completely optional! However, if you want to customize your ClipChronicle experience, you can set the following variables in a `.env.local` file inside the relevant package directory:

| Variable           | Example                                | Effect                      |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `CC_DB_PATH`       | `C:\Users\me\.clipchronicle\db.sqlite` | Custom database location    |
| `CC_BACKUP_BUCKET` | `s3://my-bucket/snippets`              | Enable encrypted S3 backups |
| `CC_DISABLE_AI`    | `true`                                 | Disable GPT features        |
| `CC_SQLCIPHER_KEY` | `My$up3rS3cr3t`                        | Encrypt database            |

Place variables in `.env.local` inside the relevant package. (i.e. `clipchronicle-landing/.env.local`, `electron-app/.env.local`, or `extension/.env.local`).

## Testing & Quality

We take quality seriously at ClipChronicle. Our testing strategy includes:

- **Unit tests** ‚Äì Vitest + React Testing Library
- **End-to-end** ‚Äì Playwright (desktop via Electron Runner and extension via Chromium)
- **Linting** ‚Äì Airbnb config + Prettier
- **Commit hooks** ‚Äì husky + lint-staged
- and more...

Run everything:

```bash
pnpm test:all
```

> [!TIP]
> Make sure you have installed the necessary dependencies for testing before running the tests!

> [!CAUTION]
> Before committing, also remember to run `npm run format` to ensure all your code conforms to the best standards!

## Continuous Delivery

To ensure a smooth release process, we use GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The workflow is as follows:

1. `pnpm changeset` bumps version and generates changelog.
2. Merge to `main` triggers the release workflow:

- Static site ‚Üí Vercel
- Electron ‚Üí notarize (macOS) / sign (EV cert) ‚Üí upload artifacts
- Extension ‚Üí ZIP draft in Chrome Web Store

3. SBOM (`cyclonedx`) and SHA-256 checksums attached to the GitHub release.
4. AWS S3 backups for the native app and extension & Google Cloud Platform/Vercel for the static site.
5. Ansible deploys the latest version to production servers.
6. Notifications sent to Discord and Twitter.

## Deployment & Infrastructure

ClipChronicle relies on both AWS and GCP for hosting, backups, and static-site delivery:

### AWS Resources
- **S3** ‚Äì Encrypted backups of the native Electron app and browser extension
- **IAM** ‚Äì Fine-grained access control policies for S3 buckets
- **KMS** ‚Äì Customer-managed keys for server-side encryption
- **CloudFront** ‚Äì Global CDN in front of S3 for low-latency delivery

### GCP Resources
- **Cloud Storage** ‚Äì Public bucket hosting the React/Next.js landing page
- **Cloud Build** ‚Äì CI pipeline to build & deploy on every push
- **IAM** ‚Äì Roles & bindings to restrict who/what can write to the bucket

### Infrastructure as Code
- **Terraform** ‚Äì Manages both AWS and GCP resources from a single codebase
- **Ansible** ‚Äì Automates deployment and configuration management
- **Vault** ‚Äì Securely stores secrets like AWS access keys and GCP service account credentials
- **Nomad** ‚Äì Orchestrates containerized workloads across AWS and GCP
- **Consul** ‚Äì Service discovery for microservices running on AWS and GCP
- **CycloneDX** ‚Äì Generates Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for compliance and security
- **Docker** ‚Äì Provides a consistent development environment for contributors
- **MkDocs** ‚Äì Documentation site hosted on GitHub Pages
- **GitHub Actions** ‚Äì CI/CD pipeline for automated testing, building, and deploying

These resources and tools ensure that ClipChronicle is not only robust and scalable but also secure and easy to maintain.
Also, these resources are made in a way that allows you or any other developer to easily get started and host/deploy ClipChronicle on your own infrastructure, whether it be AWS, GCP, or any other cloud provider.

> [!TIP]
> For more information, refer to the [AWS Directory](aws), [Ansible Directory](ansible), and [GCP Directory](gcp) in the repository.
